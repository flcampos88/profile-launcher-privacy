# Privacy Policy for Profile Launcher
*Last updated: March 19, 2025*

## 1. Introduction
The Profile Launcher is an internal Amazon Chrome extension developed exclusively for Amazon employees, designed to enhance workflow efficiency by streamlining access to multiple internal platforms. This tool facilitates seamless navigation across various Amazon internal resources while maintaining strict adherence to Amazon's comprehensive security framework and internal access policies.

## 2. Information Access and Processing
Our extension operates within carefully defined parameters, exclusively facilitating access to internal Amazon tools through authorized URL navigation. The scope of operation is limited to opening profiles in platforms that users already have permission to access through their standard Amazon authentication. The extension processes only manually selected or input login IDs, with all operations conducted entirely client-side within the user's browser environment.

## 3. Data Handling
Security and privacy form the cornerstone of our data handling approach. The extension implements a zero-retention policy, ensuring that no user data is collected, stored, or transmitted beyond the immediate needs of opening authorized internal Amazon URLs. All information processed by the extension exists purely in temporary browser memory and is immediately discarded upon window closure. This approach eliminates any potential for data persistence or unauthorized access, ensuring complete alignment with Amazon's stringent data handling requirements.

## 4. Security Implementation
The extension's architecture prioritizes security at every level, leveraging Chrome's latest secure framework (Manifest V3) and implementing comprehensive Content Security Policy protocols. By operating exclusively within Amazon's internal network domains and utilizing minimal required permissions, we maintain a robust security posture while enabling essential functionality. The extension's codebase remains open for security review, demonstrating our commitment to transparency and adherence to Amazon's security best practices.

## 5. Compliance and Access Control
Our commitment to compliance is reflected in every aspect of the extension's design. By integrating seamlessly with existing Amazon authentication mechanisms and access control frameworks, we ensure that security integrity is maintained without introducing additional vulnerabilities. The extension operates in harmony with Amazon's security monitoring tools, maintaining the established security ecosystem.

## 6. Business Continuity and Risk Mitigation
The extension has been engineered with operational resilience in mind, functioning independently without creating dependencies or interactions that could impact existing systems. Through careful design considerations, we've eliminated potential risks associated with data retention and external exposure, ensuring reliable performance within Amazon's secure environment.

## 7. Intended Use and Governance
This extension serves authorized Amazon employees by providing efficient access to internal tools while maintaining strict governance standards. Through version control and managed distribution via the Chrome Web Store's private channel, we ensure consistent oversight and compliance with Amazon's internal tool standards. Regular code reviews and updates maintain the extension's alignment with evolving security requirements.

## 8. Policy Updates
Our commitment to transparency extends to policy management. Any modifications to this privacy policy undergo thorough review and require management approval before implementation. Updates are documented and communicated through appropriate internal channels, ensuring users remain informed about the extension's privacy and security parameters.
